## Kest

Kest is a framework written in Kotlin for testing your backends. +
It relies on JUnit5 to run scenarios.

Easy to use, easy to extend.

It was created to meet the need to test backends and to interact with the middlewares on which they are based in a very simple way, in order to be able to concentrate on the functional to be tested by avoiding difficulty or heaviness brought about by interactions with multiple components.
